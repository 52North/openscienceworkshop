# Tools for reproducible & collaborative data science @ Thuenen

## Motivation & goals

Thuenen is a large organisation with researchers across many disciplines, expertises, and scientific backgrounds.
A considereable turnover of researchers regularly brings in new knowledge and skills into the different institutes.
Research questions are tackled in projects ranging from individual researchers to working groups with dozens of experts.
This diversity and adaptability is a strengh of Thuenen.
However, just as any researcher in all scientific fields, all Thuenen staff face challenges and opportunities around the topics of digitisation, reproducibility, and openness.
Cross-cutting these often technical challenges and strongly intertwined is the need to adapt personal habits and organisational structures for effective collaboration.
The need for international collaboration and ever faster reporting, sometimes on-demand, put a lot of pressure on the technical and organisational choices.
Good practices to achieve high quality scientific output based on computational reproducibility and open science exist, but not everything can be transferred directly to a diverse organisation.

Therefore, in this workshop, members of Thuenen want to lay a first foundation for developing their own practices for collaborative reproducible data science.
The workshop introduces the latest tools and practices for collaborative reproducible research and shows how they can positively impact individual and group research projects.
Participants get to know the wide variety of software libraries, publication tools, and collaboration platforms.
Some of these, depending on personal interest and previous experiences, will be practically evaluated in short hands-on sessions.

The workshop shall help researcher to get a grasp of functional and imaginable data science workflows in their respective institutes.
Based on the common language and understanding of the workshop participants, Thuenen researchers can derive shared foundations across institutes while keeping the needed flexibility.
The concept of a _toolbox_ shall help to enable the flexiblity without limiting the collaboration on lessons learned and the establishment of best practices over time.

The workshop consists of six blocks, all starting with an overview of the topic and running through the most important terms and tools.
_They should leave the workshop with clear questions to discuss with their colleagues._
Then, depending on the needs and prerequisite knowledge, specific topics are demonstrated in detail or directly evaluated hands-on.

The workshop is targeted at 12-15 people to act as multipliers across Thuenen.
Therefore, room will be kept for discussion and note taking will be done collaboratively in a living document on Thuenen's _Codi.md???_ server.
This ensures an understandable and focused output for future steps.
